## What is Consequences?
Consequences is an elaborate artificial intelligence and machine learning masterpiece to automatically moderate your Discord server and keep all the nasty children out so Discord doesn't get mad at you!

## How does Consequences work?
Consequences works by scanning every message sent, and determines whether it is a good message, or a bad message based on machine learning and on what the message content contains. If it's good, it will boost your reputation. If it's bad, it'll decrease your reputation. If your reputation goes below a certain number, you may start to experience consequences, hence the name, consequences.

## How do I host it?
It's not ready for testing yet, you'll have to figure that one out on your own. (im likely to forget to change this so if it looks done remind me to change this, thanks)
